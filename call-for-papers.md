# Overview

Building on the success of its 2010-2014
predecessors in New Delhi, India; Shanghai, China;
Seoul, South Korea; Singapore, and Beijing China, APSys 2015 will continue to be a lively
forum for systems researchers and practitioners across the world to meet, interact, and
collaborate with their peers from the Asia/Pacific region. We take a broad view of computer
systems, and solicit papers on topics such as:

* Operating systems
* Virtualization, including novel VM applications
* File and storage systems, including designs for new storage technologies
* Mobile and pervasive computing
* Cloud computing and data center management
* Distributed and networked systems
* Networks, including wireless technologies
* Internet of Things
* Energy efficiency and green computing
* Measurement, monitoring, and modeling
* Reliability, scalability, and faulttolerance
* Security and privacy
* Embedded systems
* Systems for machine learning
* Machine learning for systems
* Experience studies with deployed systems


# Submission Guidelines

Submissions should be six or fewer pages in length excluding references, formatted in
standard ACM two-column
conference style with 10-pt
font size. Reviewing is singleblind,
and the authors should have their names and affiliations in the first page of the paper. A
submission may present preliminary results, propose a new research direction, provide
insightful retrospective, or offer a provocative viewpoint on an important systems topic.
Papers will be selected based on their likelihood of generating insightful technical discussions
at the workshop and influencing future systems research. Relevant attributes include
originality, technical merit, clarity, and technical relevance. Accepted papers will appear in the
proceedings of the workshop, which will be published in the ACM Digital Library. Consistent
with standard scholarly practice, the authors should not have substantially similar work in
review anywhere else.

Submissions should be made online at [https://apsys15.kaist.ac.kr/](https://apsys15.kaist.ac.kr/).
