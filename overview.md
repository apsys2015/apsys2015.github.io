* Mobile and pervasive computing
* Cloud computing and data center management
* Distributed and networked systems
* Networks, including wireless technologies
* Internet of Things
* Energy efficiency and green computing
* Measurement, monitoring, and modeling
* Reliability, scalability, and faulttolerance
* Security and privacy
